# Convergence-of-random-variables
This is a study of the convergence of random variables.

The simulation of random variables was done using a matlab routine and again using the rejection method. The Acceptance- Rejection method is an algorithm which is used to generate random samples from a probability distribution that is not known to us.

Histograms for the distribution was computed and the probablity distribution function for the distributions was computed. A comparison for the emperical and theoretical method was completed and the reason for the differences are explained in the report.

Next, he random variables obtained are added together for each of the distributions and then divided by twice the value of its index. This results in most of the values to be obtained at values close to one.

Finally, a study of the convergence of these variables was completed based on the four types of convergence

1. Convergence in Probability
2. Almost sure convergence
3. Convergence in rth mean
4. Convergence in Law
A GUI was created using app designer in Matlab which can be used to pedagogically view how the variables behave. It consists of a plot whose behaviors change depending on the value of the number of samples T and the value of epsilon(ùúÄ)
